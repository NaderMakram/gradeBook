for this plugin to work, you need to create three Number fields with the Advanced Custom Field plugin.

1- one for attendance minimum, with the field name 'attendance_minimum'
this is used to specify the minimum number of attendance to pass the course.

2- one for attendance total, with the field name 'attendance_total'

3- one for attendance weight, with the field name 'attendance_weight'
this is used to specify the weight of attendance points in the course final grade.

all these fields should be numbers, and the location rule is in post type equal to 'course'
